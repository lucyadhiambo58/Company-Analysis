InfoTech Virtual Internship Learning Program

As interns at InfoTech we are tasked with analyzing the employee data of a company to gain insights into various aspects of its 
workforce. The dataset provided contains information about employees, their departments, salaries, 
titles, and managerial positions. Data set schema is available in excel file.

Using SQL queries and data manipulation techniques, we were expected to extract relevant information 
from the dataset and present meaningful insights to support decision-making processes within the 
organization.
